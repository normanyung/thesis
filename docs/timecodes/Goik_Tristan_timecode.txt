“Here I feel comfortable to relax in sweatpants. (I don’t have sweatpants but it’s the idea of sweatpants.)”

“My parents are Polish American, and my dad used to work in Saudi Arabia. When I was one year old, my parents made the decision to move back to their nice apartment in Sunnyside. They wanted my sister and I to have a good New York City education. I consider myself to have spent my whole life here.

I consider Sunnyside to be my personal refuge from Manhattan. Here I feel comfortable to relax in sweatpants. (I don’t have sweatpants but it’s the idea of sweatpants.) I feel safe to walk all around the neighborhood. I have a strong sense of pride for Sunnyside, but know that I am very detached from the community. I can count my Sunnyside friends on one hand. I am happy to just hang out with friends in the city and say, “Oh, I live in Sunnyside,” and smile.

I don’t really have any problems with Sunnyside, except for the ‘shoebox cinema’, a certain movie theater that is as small and sticky as a gross shoebox. Its sole redeeming value is cheap tickets. But apparently the money does not go towards training people to use the projector properly. They are very ghetto but they still checked my bags for outside food that I may or may not have had. But I need the theater and so do many others.”
