Ama Yawson Talks about the struggles she overcame to become an author and what art and money say about a culture


00:01:10	I came into writing as an adult not a child. My teachers were the authors I read growing up. 

00:04:05	I don’t do as much writing as I would like balancing art, family, Money is the hard part.
 
00:06:20	After you pay for the design. You then need about 10 thousand dollars to get the first print. You need to fight for your dream. That’s how the publishing process changed me.
00:12:45           Art needs to be able to sustain you. If you need to dilute your art to get monetary success. Then that’s not success.
