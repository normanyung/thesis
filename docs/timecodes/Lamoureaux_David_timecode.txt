I like how busy NYC is. The people everywhere. I feel like a real New Yorker because so many people are from other places.




00:01:20	Seeing the whole city in the panorama exhibit makes me think of the places I’ve lived in Brooklyn.

00:02:05	The neighborhood I live in hasn’t changed so much. A lot of the changes in the city is losing the of its culture. 
00:06:20	I loved the diversity of queens. The sights, the sounds the food.
