00:03:49	Maspeth hasn’t changed so much. It’s just different stores. It was mostly two family homes not apartments. My favorite memories of Queens is going to Reef park.

00:06:46            when I moved to New Jersey I was 11 years old. I didn’t have any friends because everyone kept to themselves. I miss that Queens is so welcoming because there are so many different ethnicities.
00:08:20     I remember 9/11 I was 7 years old. I was in class and they told us that we were going home early and that our parents were going to be called. I saw the towers fall when I was staying at my friend’s house because my mom couldn’t get back from New Jersey to pick me up.	There were just a lot of polish kids at school.
00:13:37 Everyone I knew went to the same Catholic church. I didn’t meet people from other religions until I moved to New Jersey.
00:15:35 when I was 7 my mom got a car and I didn’t have to wait for the bus anymore. My favorite way to get around was to walk because I didn’t have to wait for the bus.
00:17:16 Most of my class was on the basketball team but we didn’t have enough people we asked kids from the public school to join and then we practiced in their gym because ours was so small. We won one year and then we all went for pizza at Rosa’s.
00:27:16 My parents bribed me with a Maltese to get me into New Jersey. My boyfriend grew up in Queens so we do Queens dates some times. Everything looks smaller when I go back.
00:29:33 For high school I wanted to go to Christ the king because they had the best basket ball team. But my mom wanted me to go to an all girl’s catholic schools.

00:33:10 All my teachers were Italian even the principal Rosa’s is the best pizza. Maxamina’s is the best Ice Cream.
