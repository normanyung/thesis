Jon is a lifelong resident of New York and is currently a Biology Professor at Queens College. He briefly discusses his only two memories of the 39/40 World’s Fair –television and the “Highway of the Future”– which he visited when he was three years old. Paul explains that at the time of the fair he lived in Brooklyn and moved to Forest Hills in 1941 where he often visited Flushing Meadows Park.
