Summary:	Karen Taylor Bass talks about how she started writing and the things that have inspired her in her life.

00:00:30	I started writing as a little girl in Kingston Jamaica.

00:0:37	I came to America when I was 6 years old. . We used to tell stories at bed time and the best story won a prize. I would keep notes on my ideas throughout the day.
 
00:1:16 I think life has been my best teacher. There are so many author’s that have taught me from afar But I think it’s every day experience that has taught me the most.
00:02:19 The hardest part of being an author is constantly promoting yourself  and staying motivated to promote yourself.
00:02:28 I would tell my younger self that I am proud that you express yourself and that you never let yourself get discouraged from writing. Even when your notebook got taken away when you were 13.
00:03:50 I do public relations. I work with a lot of blue chip clients. The first book I wanted to make available to everyday people. The second book was telling people’s stories and the challenges they overcame. 
00:04:30 The market will always tell you what people want you just have to listen.

00:04:50 I want to share that I am an award winning public relations expert. I don’t sensor where ever you are is where you are supposed to be. Hang in there. Carve out time for what you want to do and see where you are after 30 days.
