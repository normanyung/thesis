Summary:	Laura Blair talks about her goals of being a writer and how writing has changed her.


00:01:22 everything is writing even if it’s just a to-do list. And when you write the information sticks with you better.  I learned this from a very early age.	 

00:01:50	the books I read and the community were my teachers and I think this made me very well rounded. I didn’t have any direct writing classes until college. Over years of writing essays and poems my writing improved. 
00:03:19	I’m very new to being a writer so I haven’t seen a huge change since I published my first book. But it’s changed the way I see and think about things
00:04:20	My research would come in the form of being attentive to teens and pre-teens. My first book is a self-help book paying attention to news was my research. 
00:06:00 If I was able to change one person’s life that is success but I would like to help as many people as possible.
