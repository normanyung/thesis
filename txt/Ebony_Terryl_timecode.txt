Summary:	

00:01:20         Circumstances caused me to just start writing about parenting	

00:02:20	I don’t love reading so when I started writing I looked at a couple books and then added my own spin.
00:04:40	Publishing my first book I got a lot of feed book. Trial and error. It made me realize I want to make more books to help people. Where I can use more of my experience as a life coach. It changed me because people new me as a author. It talked about how we need to keep growing as parents.
00:08:00     I started writing my book when my son was 13. So I would say I did 13 years of research. I know I was succesful if I changed one life.
