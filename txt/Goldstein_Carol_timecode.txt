Summary:	Carole Goldstein grew up in the sub-urbs and then moved back to queens after college. She shares her memories of growing up and finding her way as a young lesbian in New York City.


00:24:36             People seem much more open about their sexuality and happy but she misses feeling special because they had their own secret bars and secret clubs. “I remember going to this dance and they put a slide show of topless women up on that and Jackie covered my eyes”
00:30:00 “Lesbian switch board was 15 people that would tell people where the lesbian clubs were”	“that’s where I first met Jackie.”
00:37:24 I’m a little worried that things might back slide a little but I don’t know what I imagining.
