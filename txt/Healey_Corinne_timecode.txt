CORINNE HEALY
By Sabine Heinlein

“What changed my life, when I was eleven years old and moved to 41st Street, was meeting my friend Bernadette.”

“I originally lived in Sunnyside with my parents back in 1959 until 1966, and in 1996 I moved back on the same block. I love my neighbors. I would like it if people knew each other by name and greeted each other. I love the yard across the street, which is like having a little piece of countryside when I look out of my window. In the winter the snow on the trees glistens.

What changed my life, when I was eleven years old and moved to 41st Street, was meeting my friend Bernadette. This is one of the dearest people you could ever meet and I feel very blessed that today, on May 8, 2010, which is my 62nd birthday, I can still say she’s my dearest friend. She cares about everyone and you always feel special when you are around her. We have shared many laughs and also a lot of tragedies, because she is from a big family and there is always something happening in her family. I know we will always be friends.”

Corinne was interviewed by Leonore Lanzillotti at the Sound Project workshop at the Sunnyside Library. She talks about some good and bad things that happened to her in Sunnyside when she was a child.
