In the late 70s things began to change.  00:00:20 Growing up in the suburbs. Kids used to play in the streets people were more    trusting. 00:02:20 I remember the 4th of July. We used to put balloons on our bikes. Go over to    people’s yards to celebrate it. 00:04:05* Moments in the interview that would be good candidates for edited clips for the Queens Memory site should have * symbols next to the timecode (like this one does).
