Summary: Michael Kandel lives with his husband and adopted daughter in flushing. Michael shares his experience of being a school teacher, home-owner, and a father. He compares queer life in Jackson Heights, Ozone Park, Manhattan, and Douglaston.



00:00:30: Michael was born in Jackson Heights in 1959.

00:01:30: Michael, his older brother, and parents lived in a rent-controlled apartment complex in Garden Bay Manor from 1955-1977.

00:04:07: He attended William Cullen Bryant high school in Long Island City. The class of 74-76 recently reunited, with some former students traveling from the west coast to meet with their former English teacher. This reunion attests to the strong ties created in queens schooling systems.

00:05:01: There is racial unrest at William Cullen Bryant High School when his brother, who is older by three years, attends the school. Students would beat up his brother and take his lunch money. When Michael attended the racial bullying had stopped.

00:07:06 By the time he attended high school Michael found friends in his school and in surrounding schools that also identified as queer youth. The easiest and most popular places for them to hang out were someone's basement and in bars. Checking age and I.D was not as common during this time so it was easy for underaged teens to have access to bars. These bars were mostly in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Bars in queens were segregated by ethnicity rather than sexual identity.

00:10:01: Public displays of flirtation such as winks would occur between two people of the same sex in Jackson Heights. It was easy for individuals to be comfortable in their sexuality here. Ozone Park and Howard Beach was not as open to this idea because individuals here strongly adhered to their gender roles

00:11:03: Michael recalls the Summer of ‘77, the ‘Son of Sam’, and the blackout. A serial killer named David Berkowitz mostly targeted women in queens which pushed them to start tucking their hair in or change their haircuts. Michael recollects this time in New York as dangerous and falling apart; fear filled the subway stations.

00:12:30: Elephas on Northern Boulevard was a heterosexual disco venue but homosexual youth would go here. David Berkowitz struck here and instilled fear across all genders and sexualities.

00:13:41: Michael meets his husband Darryl for the first time in 1985.

00:14:40: He came out to his parents as bisexual when he was 15. His husband Darryl never got the opportunity to come out to his parents at an early age because of the cultural difference and limitations.

00:15:45: Homophobic families used to come together during the St. Patrick's day parade and spew hatred towards homosexuals. 

00:16:43: Michael goes into the career of education at the age of 40. He finds it important to present himself as an out teacher in order to serve as a guide for his students that may question their sexuality.

00:17:55: Michael and Darryl Practice resisting arrest in the March of ‘87 in DC.

00:19:25: Michael and David get married at several locations and occasions: City hall, when Domestic Partnership was passed, and Toronto. Being in a biracial relationship helped to inspire his activism.

00:21:12: Michael’s mom says, “I understand you’re gay but couldn't you keep it in the race?” which shocks Michael. In high school, he dated black women which were okay with his mother because it was a heterosexual dynamic.

00:22:16: Vito Russo played a leading role in critiquing gay life in film. Michael and Darryl attended his talks and rallies. Their friend was Vito Russo’s first cousin which allowed them to get to know him on a more personal basis.

00:23:18: Boys in the Band, a play that came out in the late 60’s, portrayed a storyline of gays who strayed away from the norm.

00:26:28: Michael and Darryl march in the first pride parade in Jackson Heights because of the incident of Julio Rivera. He remembers being invited to candlelight vigils at churches.

00:29:30: Daniel Dromm largely contributes to the first ever Queens Pride Parade.

00:30:25: Queens pride complemented Manhattan pride. Their relationship helped to increase the number of supporters and allies of the queer community

00:31:50: When Mario Cuomo ran for governor of New York sayings against the other electee were “Vote for Cuomo, not the homo!”

00:34:52: Michael and Darryl look into moving to Douglaston and their broker, upon realizing that they’re a gay couple, makes it hard for them to get a mortgage.

00:36:31: Michael decides to decorate the exterior of the house for Halloween and a blow-up skeleton is stolen from his front yard. The following August the skeleton returns hanging over their tree. A rock from their rock garden was also taken to smash the windshield of his car.

00:38:40: Michael and Darryl get the opportunity to be sponsored to join the Douglaston Country Club in 2011. There is no issue that they are a gay couple but after the sponsor realizes Michael is Jewish the offer was discontinued.

00:40:31: Before Michael and Darryl adopt their daughter from China, Michael has to sign a document that confirms his heterosexuality. Throughout the process, Michael has to find various ways to hide the fact that he is married to a man. They later tried to adopt from Vietnam and Ethiopia but there were complications there as well.

00:43:50: Families were clearly uncomfortable with Darryl when meeting him for play dates. There were times that their daughter did not get invited to birthday parties.

00:44:35: The youth are much more comfortable in their sexuality today than in previous generations. A cross-dressing student in the school that Michael teaches was not discriminated against. Recently, there was a sex transitioning third-grader which was handled very well by the teaching administration and faculty. The parents, however, were complaining. During Michael’s time as a student in high school alternative feelings on sex and gender were kept on the down low and not as public as they are today.

00:47:40: Michael is concerned for the gay youth today who get taken advantage of by adults who display predatory behavior in public transit. This is where his personal activism continues in always encouraging his daughter and students to be aware of their surrounding. 

00:50:38: In 1974 Drag was big in the bars in Jackson Heights.

00:53:10: In his youth, Michael and his friends would take part in drugs during their free time which may have gone hand in hand with their questioning sexual identities. During this time quaaludes, poppers, and pot were popular. Public smoking of marijuana was not as big of an issue during this time.

00:55:44: Frye Boots, platform shoes, and orange polyester were popular fashion trends during the 1970s. New York’s style as a whole was grunge-like.

00:59:59: Handkerchiefs in the back left or right pockets would determine whether someone was a top or a bottom.

01:00:40: Michael recollects being a suit fitter at Bloomingdales and having older men flirt with him.

01:01:50: Michael wants to see a change in the quantity and quality of housing offered to homeless queer youth who are kicked out of their homes.
