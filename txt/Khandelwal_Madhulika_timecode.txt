Summary: Dr. Madhulika Khandelwal, who first came to the U.S. from India as an international graduate student more than 25 years ago, traces her evolution from student to immigrant at home in Queens. As Professor of Urban Studies at Queens College, Director of its Asian/American Center, and advisor to the Queens General Assembly, she continues to observe the immigrant experience and believe in the philosophy of unity through diversity.

	00:01:27  Khandelwal left India (1984) as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh.  For PHD research on/in Indian immigrant communities, she moved (1986-87) to Queens which has become her home.

00:05:00  Fall 1987 At new Queens College Asian/American Center, directed by Sanjeev Raj, MK joined “New Immigrants and Old Americans Project” as a research historian.  Her focus was oral history, but also inter-disciplinary studies.  

00:08:30  1997   With PHD from Carnegie Mellon, MK left QC to teach Asian American studies at U. Mass, Boston, commuting from New York.

00:09:39   Returned to Queens College in 2002 as Director of Asian/American Center. 

00:11:50  Published: Becoming American, Being Indian: An Immigrant Community in New York (Cornell University, 2002).  Accepted self as Queens person.

00:13:13 Questioned about arrival in US, MK admits that growing up, educated, in India, teaching at University of  Delhi, she had a “negative attitude.”    She came to learn, stay short time (not for money or to forget culture). Research and community involvement at QC’s Asian American Center changed her from student to immigrant—“an ongoing journey.”

00:18:36  How did America meet expectations?   Coming with with pride andstrong self esteem, MK felt shock and surprise, yet found beauty (i.e. Central Park), people with  spiritual values; this  “discovery of self and America continues.”   
 
00:22:11  First read about environmentalists in America.  Americans don’t project themselves and country well.   Found self enlightenment.

00:24:10 As Professor of Urban Studies at Queens College, she sees democratic transition in her   students who live in city’s communities

00:26:30  Queens General Assembly consists of representatives of Queens’ community boards. MK became advisor (thanks to Sanji,  Borough President Helen Marshall,  and Susie Tanenbaum [Special Assistant on Immigrant & Inter-Cultural Affairs].  Immersed in and learning others’ immigrant experiences, MK has enriched her own identity 

00:36:20 Dr. Khandelwal appreciates the Queens General Assembly, yet feels its importance lies in the spirit of human, cultural understanding, the practical application of unity within diversity.
