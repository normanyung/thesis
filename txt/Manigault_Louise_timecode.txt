Summary:	Paragraph about person interviewed, synopsis of interview

00:01:20	My family had a lot of teachers in it. As I grew up I had teachers that encouraged me to write. After I graduated college I started writing self help books.

00:04:35 All my books are based on faith. My largest book has 185 meditations. One of my teachers was my preacher because I listen to what he says and I learn from him.	
00:07:20	The hardest part of my artistic process is coming up with an idea.

00:08:30 I would tell my younger self to write from the heart. My meditations affect my life because I read my meditations when I‘m having a bad day.
