Here, he gives us a candid recap of the first day after the storm and what it was like from a first responder’s point of view.  00:00:22 EMS/ Fire Department for NYC workers are contacted through 911     computer system, work along side Army National Guard during      emergencies 00:01:16 there were still active fires in the morning hours 7:00am. Resources were    pulled from other emergencies/citizens to work the fires. 00:02:00 Set up security detail near Crossbay Bridge. Streets still covered with     sand and mud. Ordinary emergency vehicles unable to maneuver the     streets needed Army Humvees. 00:03:15 Night of Sandy, there was no way for them to respond to the 911 calls     because the major roads were flooded. The trucks were unable to get in     to fight the fires at Breezy Point. There was a standing order to ‘just rescue’    people. Goal was “Life over Property” 00:04:20 In vicinity of B102- B105. Boardwalk is gone. Water receded quickly but    6-12 inches of sand blanketing the neighborhoods. Sanitation came in to     cart the sand away. Cars moved hundreds of feet, stacked on top of each     other. Pieces of Boardwalk traveled 300 plus feet inland. Cars windows     smashed from people trying to escape their vehicles, bus stop glass     shattered.  00:07:27 After the storm, when there was the gas shortage in Queens, some people tried to    siphon gas from their storm damaged vehicles. People were boarding up the    houses because of wind damage. 00:07:51 Along Rockaway Beach Drive, near B116, Many store fronts burned down    during the storm. If EMS workers had a reason to believe that a person was    trapped inside they would’ve tried to get into the buildings. Buildings burnt so    hot that the metal beams were bent and melted. This was a few entire blocks in    each direction. Fire Marshalls responded after to survey damage. 00:08:59 There are many displaced residents with no place to go, who were placed into    shelters on the mainland. Queens College became one of many temporary    shelters.  00:10:01 There is still the smell of burnt wood and debris from the fires, and it is still    smoldering in places. Drove up and down in the Military Humvee, to ensure no    fires restarted. Small flare-ups were put out immediately. Complete devastation.  00:12:13 Water in the Rockaways was contaminated after the storm. Sewage spilt over    into the water plants. Residents couldn’t drink the water from their pipes. 00:13:08 Going towards Breezy Point through Belle Harbor was still difficult the next day    since there was 2-3 feet of water in the streets. Military Humvee (made for this    type of  driving) having difficulty. Breezy Point’s main road [Rockaway Point    Blvd] still flooded, water pumps attempting to clear the water from the streets    using the same lines that would have been used to bring water in to fight the    fires, it took several days. Also did this for the residential homes in the area as    sitting water can create an unsafe living environment. 00:14:07 Playground that was once fenced in near Atlantic Ocean, now surrounded by    water and sand, on Devon Walk and Oceanside Drive. 00:15:52 In many homes sand washed away from underneath concrete foundations    causing them to sink into the ground. 00:17:24 Lots of people stayed in their homes. Water caused more problems than the    winds, and kept emergency vehicles from responding to calls. Once the water    came in (between 3 and 8 feet in places) residents tried to leave but were     stranded in stalled vehicles. 00:19:29 Breezy Point community is known because of the many firefighters that lived    there that were lost on September 11th, 2001.  00:20:07 Breezy Point homes were originally vacation homes, converted to year round    living. Streets are narrow, only 4- 5 feet wide, which does not allow for     emergency vehicles to have access. Flood waters made it completely impossible.    Blocks in flames looked like a giant bonfire, near Olive Walk and Devon Walk.    The same lines used to try to put out fire the night before, now used to pump    water out of Breezy Point. 00:21:58 Local residents have put up an American flag on the frame of a storage shed.    Extremely close community - Neighbors helping neighbors. 00:25:04 Power wires down are on the ground, the poles not as strong as they should be.    Propane tanks scattered everywhere. Most homes ran off propane, few gas lines    installed. Fireplaces are what are left of most homes. Personal belongings are    gone forever. Entire blocks are unrecognizable.  00:29:03 Homes that were 10 feet from fire had siding melt off but stayed intact. Fire    Engines only got as close as Rockaway Point Blvd. 00:31:12 Life Alert for elderly, works off of electricity, unable to be used because of    power outages. 911 was unable to get to anyone needing medical attention during   the storm. Residents were unable to use telephones. Many people lost their lives    because emergency responders were unable to get to them. 00:33:51 Water remained in the low-lying areas of Breezy Point the day after the storm.    Homes  pushed inland, sinkholes created from waters. 00:35:20 Help (Humvees) came from the Bronx National Guard that arrived to Fort    Hamilton within 8-9 hours from as far as Buffalo, NY.  00:36:00 Hi-Rise buildings/ Apartment buildings with no power, needed EMS and    National Guard  to carry people out/perform patient care, rescue, carried supplies    in. 00:39:24 Memorial Bench for firefighters that perished on 9/11 sustained no damage from    the storm. 00:40:27 Emergency workers gave up their days off to assist in the efforts in the     Rockaways, and helped out the local emergency workers who had lost     everything. Everything had to come in from the mainland. 00:42:01 Because of massive power outage on the Rockaways, travelling at night was    immensely difficult and dangerous. Army provided gasoline for First Responders   throughout the gas shortage. 00:44:32 North of the Belt Parkway in Queens didn’t experience the destruction from    Hurricane Sandy that the Rockaways did, sense of disconnect around the     borough. Northern Queens went back to normal quickly while the Rockaways    still devastated. 00:46:12 Flags are being put up all along the Rockaways.  00:46:24 In Riis Park, Sanitation was trying to cart all of the sand out of the way to help    responders get to areas in need of help. Fire Engine Company 286 gets stuck in    the sand. 00:47:58 First rows of homes facing the ocean seem to have sustained the worst damage    from the storm. All along the coastline there is damage of varying degrees 00:53:11 Emergency response workers and the Army National Guard rescue victims of    Hurricane Sandy and pick up supplies for FEMA and the American Red Cross to    distribute to those in need. 00:53:38 The Rockaways showed no signs of being a modern day community. People    were cooking over open fires in garbage cans, no recognizable signs of city    living. Originally drove around in canopy Humvees, which had to be replaced    with armored Humvees due to random gunfire.             Pic 1: Member of EMS from the Bronx, around 7am in Rockaway, near Crossbay Veterans Memorial Bridge, just finishing an active fire  Pics 2-3: With a Sergeant of the Army National Guard based out of the Bronx, setting up security detail- near Brian’s Auto Emporium (8715 Beach Channel Drive)  Pic 4: Emergency vehicles assigned by the city were continuously getting stalled due to the high water and sand that came in from the ocean- Army allowed the use of military trucks to get around in order to respond and rescue in areas otherwise inaccessible- Shore Front Parkway  Pic 5: Sanitation truck carting away sand from the streets that came in with the storm- going towards Beach 102 Street.  Pic 6: Cars that were parked normally had been pushed 100 feet in by the storm waters, all the way to the Boardwalk in some cases- Beach 104 street.  Pic 7: Cars are covered in wood that was once the Boardwalk.  Pic 8: Cars pushed around like toys.  Pic 9:  Cars stacked on top of each other, over turned by the force of the water during the storm  Pic 10: Pieces of the Boardwalk that travelled as much as 300 feet inland- Beach 105 street  Pic 11: Bus stop glass is smashed in the direction that the water flowed, yet remains intact on the sides.
