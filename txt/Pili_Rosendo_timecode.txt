Summary: Rosendo Pili, a Filipino American immigrant, was born in Manila, Philippines. He has four sisters and four brothers and they were all born in the Philippines. The family moved to Queens, New York when he was four years old; because of political reasons. He talks about growing up in Queens in the 90’s and what sort of activities he was part of as a child. Moreover, he talks about his exploration of the hip hop genre, becoming an MC, and being a member of an all Filipino group band called “ Deep Foundation”.

00:01:02	he was born in Manila, Philippines and spent four years of his life there. 

00:01:19	his life began to take shape as a Filipino immigrant when the family moved to Queens in 1989. 

00:02:31	lived in a basement at 64th and Broadway of Woodside, Queens for sixteen or seventeen years.

00:03:30	New York in the 90’s was the worst time to live in because the area he grew up in was not a place to raise a child. For instance, He remembers being four or five years old; playing with rocks in the backyard when he noticed two boys jumping his neighbor’s fence and stealing the neighbor’s television set. This particular memory stood out to him because it was the first time something illegal happened in front of him.  

00:05:53	his parents were really protective of him and his siblings because Woodside, Queens was very different from what they were used to back home. Therefore, the kids were not allowed to venture outside of their home on their own.  

00:06:39	Attended P.s 152 (33-52 62nd Street, Queens, NY 11377). 

00:07:45	was part of an all Pilipino Choir. They would go house to house for caroling and they would sing at St. Sebastian (58-02 Roosevelt Avenue Woodside, NY 11377) and Queen of Angel (44-04 Skillman Ave, Sunnyside NY 11104). 

00:08:09	Maria Declare was the person who organized all of the events. Unfortunately, she passed away because of cancer, when he was in seventh grade. 

00:09:20	His family was the only Asian family in the block. This caused them to have some altercation with their neighbors. 

00:12:11	the choir had children from all different age groups. For instance, he joined it when he was five years old. His older sister on the other hand, joined the Choir when she was seventeen years old. 

00:12:49	His school had a couple of kids that were Filipinos, but they were over shadowed by the demographic, which were mostly Indian and Dominicans children at that time.  

00:13:20	the family attended St. Sabastian Church (58-02 Roosevelt Avenue Woodside, NY 11377). 

00:13:27	the choir he was part of was not organized at St. Sebastian. However, they would practice at the church and sing for the mass. 

00:13:51	the church had a lot of Filipino members. 

00:14:41	Most of the Pilipino stores would be in 69th and 5th.   

00:15:11	the family would go to Crystals once in a while and go to Phil-Am because there were certain things that you could only find at that particular grocery store. 

00:16:31	a lot of the things they would do as a family would be at the church because he came from a big family.

00:17:18	they would rent movies sometimes, on Sunday from Jafelly’s  video store in Roosevelt.  

00:19:48	the family would go to the 65th street Park, which was right across from the house they lived in. 

00:22:15	His father used to work as an office admin for the government and was a speech writer as well. However, the family had to move due to political reasons and not feeling safe anymore in the Philippines.        

00:23:48	His uncle, got them the visa and they were all able to move to America as a family. 

00:24:00	his father had to completely relocate the family to a place where he had very little family, friends, and no job prospect due to his age. There was also a lot of xenophobia directed toward Asians because they were the next immigrant that were coming in in the 90’s and taking space in areas that was predominately black and Latino.  

00:25:20	his father worked as a security guard in Alexander’s in Queens BLVD after moving to New York. Alexander similar to Sears.

00:26:29	In the beginning, his mother did not work at all because she had to stay at home to take care of the kids.

00:27:41	the children would get sick all the time because they were not used to or prepared for the cold weather. 

00:27:49	they used to get clothes from the Salvation Army or his cousins would give them the clothes they grew out of. 

00:28:50	His first memory of Queens was going to school for the first time. He was really scared and cried a lot. 

00:30:25	Remembers kindergarten being a confusing time for him. 

00:30:31 	People would also think that he did not know how to speak English. However, his parents taught him how to speak English even before moving to the United States. Still, he was placed into special Ed class because he colored both side of his paper red when he was supposed to only draw something in red.  

00:35:32	as a child, he caught on to things really quickly. Therefore, he was a trouble maker by the time he was in second or third grade. 

00:40:42	Attended middle school at P.s 122 (21-21 Ditmars Blvd, Queens, NY 11105). Most of the friends he has made are from junior high school because it was a small program and there were about sixty kids in his grade. 

00:41:19	the school was about forty minute train ride from his home. Therefore, it provided him with a level of independence when he started junior high school. 

00:42:45	The School provided the students with metro card; it was a white and green card and the students were given three swipes a day so they had to be really carful as to how they used them. 

00:48:44	Attended Bronx Science High School. He took a specialized test in junior high school for it and he took that test twice because the proctor messed up. 
 
00:54:51	 his experience in Bronx Science was eye opening for him because he got to see how the rest of the city lived. For him, high school was about making friends so he did not take it seriously. 
00:59:36	Clinton High School (10 East 15th Street, New York, NY 10003) used to share the same block as Bronx Science. Since they were not in the same league academically; they would always compete against each other in track.

01:02:25	Gangs were a big thing at Harlem and Bronx during that time, so he remembers guys wearing red bandana and green bandanna during 1998 to 2002.

01:03:51	music was a huge part of his life because everyone in his family knew how to sing. Two of his sister knew how to play the piano and guitar and one of his brothers also knew how to play the guitar. 
 
01:05:17	started writing poetry in third or Fourth grade. 

01:06:27	He remembers people freestyling in the train and rapping during his junior high school years. However, he still did not make the connection because hip hop is considered a joke to older Filipino. Therefore, he thought of it as a joke as well. 

01:08:35	that part of his personality started to expand during high school, because he was exposed to people who supported hip hop. It was during his freshmen year of high school; after writing his first rhyme and reciting it to everyone that he started to see himself as an MC. 

01:09:48	he would go to friend Greg Tubales house in Queens to break dance in the basement with Ryan Punsalon, Richard Neylis, and Suitcase (Michael Capito).  

01:11:25	MC-ing, for him was like creating an identity in high school. 

01:12:16	His earliest influencer was DMX, Ruff Riders. Yonkers was really important to him. He went to school nearby and his girlfriend was from Yonkers, but also Yonkers and the Bronx had a huge and flourishing Hip-Hop scene. 

01:13:55	He met one of the other members of Deep Foundation; an all Filipino group band, Poetic when he was fifteen years old; at a mutual friends sweet sixteen party. They were both part of the cotillion and had to practice for it, so they became friends and kept in touch. Many cotillions were held in Astoria, but this one was by Elmhurst. 

01:15:33	it was a year or two later, that he and Mark became part of the Deep Foundation group. All the other members were already part of the group. Mainly were guys from New Jersey plus Rosendo and Mark. Members names: verbal teck, words arise, proceeds (CJ), and poetic. 

01:18:06	Most of the groups music were lyrical. The internet had a huge presence during that time and people would rap battle each other through instant messenger. Internet rap was a huge thing. People would battle on IM. The best would flourish out of this and actually make it big.  

01:22:15	 One of the first song concept; the group’s first content based song was called Pain and Loss, which was about September 11th in 2002.

01:24:18	the group’s first album was called “First Draft” and it was released around 2007.

01:26:20	some of the highlights that stands out to him are: making the album, traveling, and touring. 

01:33:29	recalls going to the wonder bread Factory with his sister in 37th to get bread and have a party in their home. Woodside was not always a Filipino community, when he was around it was just developing. To him, it did not matter if he was Filipino or not because everything was accessible where he was living in.
