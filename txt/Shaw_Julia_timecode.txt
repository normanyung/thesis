Summary:	Paragraph about person interviewed, synopsis of interview


00:00:00	Description 

00:02:20	The person who influenced me the most was John Septo. Prior to meeting him I didn’t think there were any black children’s books out there.

00:03:50*	I started selling black children’s books to schools and bring these books out into the world.
00:04:40	The most challenging part to me was the change in the industry. The influence of social media. In the beginning publishing companies didn’t realize that e books were around to stay so publishers ended up being behind the curve.
00:07:11*  I started making advertisements. Where you try to use as few words as possible. When I became an author I had to learn to expand my writing and use more words.
