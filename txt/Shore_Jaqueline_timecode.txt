00:04:00 We went dancing at one of the oldest lesbian bars “The grove”. We had been dating for a year before I formerly asked her out. We sat on the pier holding hands.
00:08:15 I used to go on a date with a boy every once and awhile to get them out of my face
00:09:00 When, I first told my parents I was lesbian. My mom told me I had a year to straighten myself out.
00:10:10 when, I turned 21, I got my first job with the Department of education and I moved out. I don’t hink I had anything with me. I took the car but I don’t think I had any clothes or anything.
