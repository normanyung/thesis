00:00:15 – 00:03:03
Briefly, Mr. Stein speaks about his involvement with the Aids Center of Queens County (ACQC) since the late 1980’s. 
Started volunteering at the AIDS Center of Queens County (ACQC) in 1991, joined their Board in 1994 and served for 21 years as Secretary, Treasurer, and then Vice President. 
ACQC offers social services assistance (advocacy, education, testing, legal services, housing referrals, etc.) for individuals affected by HIV. 
ACQC then became part of a larger, San Francisco-based organization, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation. 
00:03:03 – 00:05:10
Briefly, Mr. Stein discusses his involvement with the Queens Pride Parade
Involvement in ACQC led Mr. Stein to become involved in the Queens Pride Parade.
Mr. Stein became Treasurer of the Queens Pride Parade committee in June 2000 and served as Treasurer until 2012. 
He also directs traffic on 37th Ave. on the day of the parade. 
Mr. Stein also helps organize Winter Pride, an annual fundraiser held by the Queens Pride Parade to raise money for the parade. 
00:05:10 – 00:06:22
Briefly, Mr. Stein speaks about his involvement with the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens (LGDCQ)
LGDCQ is borough-wide, not neighborhood-based. 
Mr. Stein served as Secretary and Vice President of the club. 
00:06:22 – 00:08:00
Mr. Stein speaks about how he got involved in AIDS and LGBTQ advocacy
Heard about “gay-related immune deficiency” (GRID) in the news and realized that his friends may have been susceptible 
Attended meetings around New York City (at Body Positive, People with Aids (PWA) Coalition, and Gay Men’s Health Crisis (GMHC)) to educate himself on the topic
Learned about ACQC at a street fair following the Manhattan Pride Parade 
00:08:00 – 00:11:13
Mr. Stein on knowing people suffering from HIV at the height of the crisis
“In 1995, HIV was essentially a death sentence.” 
In that era, ACQC’s work focused on end-of-life care and burial arrangements
Mr. Stein explains how HIV operates in the body. 
Mr. Stein explains how HIV prohibited people from working, and therefore being able to afford housing, food, medication, and other basic needs. 
00:11:13 – 00:13:26
The discovery of “protease inhibitor” drug in 1995 made HIV treatable, and no longer a “death sentence”.
In the 1980’s and 90’s, Mr. Stein attended many HIV funerals. He notes that he has attended very few funerals because of HIV since 1995.
00:13:26 – 00:15:14
Prior to 1995, there were many “false starts” regarding HIV treatment, so people were skeptical of the protease inhibitor’s effectiveness when it was first introduced. 
Protease inhibitor couldn’t reverse disease for people whose infection was far along, but was “lifechanging” for newly-infected people.
00:15:14 – 00:21:22
On how ACQC’s mission and services changed over time with medical and social developments regarding HIV/AIDS
ACQC’s first office was in Richmond Hill, Queens. Met with resistance and hostility from the community, and assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio. 
In 1988, ACQC was forced to move, and relocated to Rego Park (63rd Dr. and Queens Boulevard). (NOTE: ACQC subsequently moved to Jamaica, Queens when the Rego Park building was rezoned from being commercial to residential).
As more people became infected, public perception of the disease changed and became more accepting. 
As a community-based organization (CBO), ACQC receives state (New York Department of Health’s AIDS Institute) and federal (Ryan White grant) government funding. 
Explanation of how the “Ryan White” grants got started 
The types of services ACQC offers haven’t changed, but the number of people using certain types of services has. For instance, ACQC still arranges for housing for HIV-positive people, but now that the disease is mostly manageable and doesn’t prohibit most people from working, they focus less on end-of-life and burial services. 
00:21:22 – 00:25:42
On how relying on government funding influenced/es ACQC’s programming
New York State AIDS Institute encouraged ACQC to establish a needle exchange (“harm reduction”) program for intravenous drug users in Queens. 
Such programs already existed in Manhattan and Brooklyn, but not in Queens, the Bronx, or Staten Island.
Encountered community resistance when searching for a location
AIDS Institute also funded ACQC having lawyers, an education program, and condom distribution
00:25:42** - 00:29:24
On encountering/overcoming community resistance in AIDS/LGBTQ advocacy 
In Richmond Hill, community resistance and hostility forced ACQC to relocate to Rego Park
When working to establish the needle exchange program, ACQC visited community boards of areas with high instances of HIV.
Thomas Freidan, NYC Department of Health Commissioner at the time (now of the CDC), accompanied ACQC’s Executive Director to community board meetings.
HIV statistics by zip code collected by the Department of Health helped ACQC provide evidence to community boards about the need for intervention in their communities 
The need for needle exchanges was concentrated in Queensbridge, Far Rockaway, and Jamaica.
Needle exchange program operates out of a van
00:29:24 – 00:34:30
Queens Pride Parade
First Queens Pride Parade was in June1993. Mr. Stein joined the parade committee in 1996.
Unsure what the community response would be, so high security was put in place (police snipers, helicopters, etc.)
Pride Parade in Manhattan had been happening since 1969, and hadn’t had any issues
Jackson Heights was chosen as the location of the parade because it already had gay bars and nightlife
Queens Pride Parade is characterized as more “family friendly” than the Manhattan parade. Mr. Stein: “It’s pretty vanilla, in a sense.”
Queens Pride Parade has marching bands, music, street fair
One year, the parade faced some resistance from the Muslim community in Jackson Heights.
Many other parades use the route down 37th avenue, so in some ways the Queens Pride Parade just feels like another one of the many parades that there are. 
00:34:30 – 00:36:23
People who march in the parade each year: ACQC, marching bands, gay gymnasts, political groups, politicians, religious organizations
Parade route: on 37th Ave, from 89th St. to 75th St. 
00:36:23 – 00:38:20
Jackson Heights as a center of LGBTQ culture in Queens
People in other neighborhoods also formed a group call “Out Astoria”, “Out Forest Hills”, and “Out Far Rockaway”
Most gay bars are located in Jackson Heights and Astoria
00:38:20** – 00:43:10
On how LGBTQ community and activism in Queens differs from that of Manhattan
Queens Pride Parade focuses on LGBTQ visibility/awareness, while the Manhattan pride march is more civil rights-oriented. Manhattan march is bigger, more risqué, political, receives more corporate sponsorship. 
To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Queens Pride Parade, the Queens museum curated a special exhibit about the history of the parade
00:43:10 – 00:46:20
On working with the Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club of Queens
Daniel Dromm helped start a Queens chapter of PFLAG with founder Jean Manford, who lived in Queens. Daniel founded the LGDCQ in 1994 or 1995.
The Club endorses and supports political candidates who support its agenda, which is to minimize discrimination against gay people. 
00:46:20 – 00:48:24 
On his career as a public school teacher
Graduated from City College of New York in 1970, commuting from Jamaica
From 1970 - 1991, taught math at a middle school in Brooklyn
In 1991, transferred to Russel Sage Junior High School
Retired from NYC public schools in 2002, after thirty-two years of teaching.
Taught at Iowa State in the fall semesters of 2002, 2003 and 2004 while maintaining his Forest Hills residence. 
00:48:24 – 00:50:47
Mr. Stein explains the relationship between him and his housemate, an international student from India (who had walked through the room earlier). 
00:50:47 – 00:57:49
On NYC public school system’s attitude toward LGBTQ issues
His students dealt with verbal taunts and mocking, but no physical violence.
Many teachers, including Mr. Stein, did not come out to their students, or to their colleagues.
Mr. Stein discusses growing up going to a Catholic school in Queens (Parsons St. and 79th Ave.)
Attended Archbishop Malloy High School, and then City College. 
00:57:49 – 00:59:49
On his faith and LGBTQ identity
Attended Catholic school for grades 1-12. 
Catholic.
Keeps his identity private; easy in a faith tradition that doesn’t stress fellowship and socializing.
00:59:49 – 01:02:25
Hopes for the future of the LGBTQ community in Queens
Continue raising consciousness about the LGBTQ community, both locally and on a larger scale. “No hopes, dreams, or aspirations” “We’ve essentially won the battle in New York City, but we haven’t necessarily won the battle elsewhere”. 
01:02:25 – 01: 02:56
