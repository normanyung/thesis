00:00:00               Florence Taylor-Johnson was born in Manhattan on December 30, 1928. Three months later, her family uprooted and moved to Elmhurst, Queens. She remarks how Queens was a lot different back than it is now.  One major change she noticed were the ethnic demographics in her neighborhood. 
00:10:35            Florence recalls her family being one of the first families of African American descent in the neighborhood. She often felt discriminated against—which cut like a knife. 
00: 18:42        Florence believed her children had a good childhood and appreciated it. However, she does not think her grandchildren did. 
00:19:43      Florence received her high school diploma from Flushing High School in 1946. Her parents encouraged her to attend college. However, she chose the latter and decided to get married and start a family. 
00:20:40    On the weekends, Florence enjoyed going to the movies with her brother and taking weekends trips with her family. 
00:27:40     Florence had the opportunity to join the Civil Rights March in Washington. Doing this made her fee like she was a part of something greater then herself. This also made her feel she could make improve social conditions.
00:29:04   Although, Florence was busy with her family, she always made time to march. She recalls marching in the Labor Day Parade with a baby carriage. Although she was not able to march as often when she became a mother, she felt it was the quality of the time she gave is what counted. 
00:33:42   She feels people growing up in 1995 were different from the generation she was a part of. She makes a distinction saying that adults the mid-1990s weren’t as outspoken about political and social issues. She believes this is because people are concerned with keeping their jobs and what the people around them thought. Florence believed this was out of fear of being called racist. 
00:36:42  In March 1968, Florence was working  at a local social security office. A few days after Florence started her employment, Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.  This event upset her very much and what angered her even more was the fact that people had acted like nothing had happened. She was so bothered by this experience that she decided to walk out. Her boss told her that if she left she would be fired and she calmly responded “I guess I’ll be fired”. She described the time period between the death of MLK and funeral as a “traumatic time”. 
00:38:25   Florence recalls being ridiculed for being an activist.
