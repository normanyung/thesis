Summary: Tammara Tillman was one of the pioneering women in the Queens MC community during the rise of hip hop in NYC during the 1970s and 1980s. She was born and raised in Queens and lived in multiple neighborhoods in the borough throughout her life. In this interview, Tammara discusses her influence on the Queens hip hop community and talks about her many interactions with some of the most important names from that era, including LL Cool J, Spyder D, Jam Master Jay and groups like Infinity Machine and the Disco Twins. In addition, Tammara opens up about her difficult childhood, including her time in shelters and group homes.

00:04:00: Her parents migrated from the South. Her father was born in Augusta, Georgia. Her mother was born in Columbia, North Carolina. Her mother migrated to NY in the 1960s and met her father while living in Long Island with some aunts.

00:06:00: Her mother suffered from mental illness. She was a patient at Creedmoor Hospital in Queens Village.
00:06:00: Tammara and her neighbor, “Pee-Wee”, in Corona would make mudpies. Her recollections then circle back to the day her mother left her father and how it affected her father. Before her mother took Tammara and moved out, Tammara used to attend games at the Mets Clubhouse with her father.
00:08:19: After her mother left her father, they moved into a house with her mother’s friends on South Road. She and her mother ended up on 164th Street on the south side of Jamaica. They moved onto the same block with some of her mother’s cousins.

00:12:57: When she had lived in Corona with her mother and father, she was surrounded by music. Her father’s family was involved in music. They would often play music in the house. Her mother had been in a Baptist choir. This helped influence her love of music from early on.

That year, Paul gave Tammara a chance at the mic. By 1976, she was well-known.
00:20:22: Tammara describes rapping at the age of eleven and how people were amazed at how she could “drop some bars.”

00:26:25: Dancing, MCing and music were Tammara’s escape. Tammara would sneak out of the house for park jams. 
00:26:50: Tammara discusses her high reading and math levels in the 6th grade.
00:27:25: Tammara used to rap in the hallways and back staircases at her school.

00:31:50: Tammara was getting into a lot of fights by the age of 13.
00:32:00: She used to lie about her age to get into the popular Queens clubs, Fantasia and the Foghouse, for jam sessions. Tammara interacted with Future Sounds, Jamaica Sounds and other Queens MC crews at these events. MCing was done in parks, house parties, block parties. At this point, hip hop was widespread.
00:33:00: At this point in the interview, Tammara had a head cold and needed a break so we paused the interview. Part 2 resumed with Tammara talking about Hollis.
00:33:50: Tammara discusses how she unintentionally converted her mother to Jehovah’s Witnesses but later rejected attending services in order to attend jams.

Children from all boroughs were sent there to stay before being transferred to other locations like Boy’s Town, group homes, or foster homes. 
00:38:50: She talks about her cousin, Jamaica (Junior), who was involved in the gang Seven Crowns and was involved with the Savage Skulls. He had taught her how to fight. He found out that she was at the group home and would come to check in on her. He knew that she was a “dope MC”.
00:40:07: Tammara was a freestyle rapper in addition to writing rhymes down. She says she was one of the originals to do so. It was second nature to her.
00:40:17: Tammara circles back to her cousin, Junior, who made sure she was safe in the group home. He would also sneak her out so that she could MC at jams in the south side of Queens.
00:40:34: There were quite a few MCs at QSPCC. Tammara was generally quiet at the group home. DJs would come to the group home sometimes. She tells a story about how she asked to get on the mic for one of these sessions. She amazed the counselors at the group home with her raps.

00:47:20: Tammara recalls a dance marathon for a non-profit. It was the first time Tammara encountered Infinity Machine. Tammara MCed at the event. WWRL 1600 was there. Tammara won the marathon. She danced for 25 hours. She describes her encounter with members of Infinity Machine, including Divine and Goody.

01:06:27: At this point, Tammara was well-known enough that she was hired for parties in Jamaica Estates. She would be paid for these events.
01:07:08: Tammara discusses how she evolved with the expansion of the MC community. 
01:07:20: Tammara recalls an old rhyme from an earlier period and explains that rapping evolved away from that.
01:07:45: Tammara was around eighteen when MC records started coming out.
01:08:00: Tammara’s first studio was Power Play. She describes being nervous. She disliked the beat that the engineer had composed. She thought it was too flat and monotone. She could rap to anything, but she was more used to jazzy beats. One of her signature stylistic choices was Barry White.

She tried to get him off but was unsuccessful. Once her cousin left, she was the last from her crew in Hollis.
01:15:10: Tammara lived at 190-25 Woodhull Ave. She would go to Jamaica Park jams. Spyder-D took notice of her then.
01:15:30: Tammara talks about being a female MC and how the girls would compete for attention.
01:16:30: Tammara talks about her association with Crazy T and the south side crew, Imperial 5 [spelling?]. Crazy T ended up getting strung out on crack.
01:18:20: Tammara brings up the crack epidemic which hit south side Queens. “It was terrible.” Crazy T was the first MC that she knew that died from it.
01:19:22: Tammara talks about her style of MCing. “When you’re really MCing, you’re in a flow.” She describes it like a natural high. Tammara had different ranges in her style, including the “old radio broadcast.”
01:20:10: Tammara was approached in Harlem by Sylvia Robinson’s “people” for her work. She was still at her foster mother’s house and at this time was concerned with finding a lawyer before agreeing to making records.
01:20:20: Tammara introduced hip hop to Grover Cleveland High School.
01:20:38: Tammara had a strained relationship with her foster sister who was jealous of her. Her foster sister was at the time into one of the Disco Twins, who she would MC with occasionally.

She says that the Disco Twins had another woman MC, Nasty T, with them at one of the parks near the Louis Armstrong School. 
01:21:20: Tammara discusses the start of the Jamaica Armory gigs. The Disco Twins would MC there with Nasty T. She talks about meeting the Mercedes Ladies, including Sherry-Sher, Zina Zee, and Eve-a-Def. They had just recorded with Sugarhill Gang. Tammara was approached once again about making a record, but she was again concerned about having a lawyer.
01:22:15: Tammara circles back to her relationship with her foster sister and how she was jealous of the attention that Tammara was getting for her MCing, despite the fact that Tammara wanted to have her foster sister sing choruses for her in the studio. The competition between them became worse.
01:23:00: Tammara discusses stopping MCing briefly after getting sexually assaulted three weeks before her 18th birthday. Another time she had taken a break from MCing was when she was sixteen and her appendix had erupted. That time, she had been in the hospital for ten days.
01:23:33: MCing helped her through her childhood and teen trauma. It was an outlet, a self-expression for her. A mic was her source of healing. It wasn’t just “a thing to do.”
01:24:34: Tammara got a job after school at Western Beef to make money. She was still MCing, but her job took up her time.
01:25:19: Tammara was put out of her foster home when she was 18. At the time, Tammara thought it was a good thing since her foster mother could not afford the cost of a lawyer for Tammara. She was supposed to get a trust fund from her father, but because she was put out so suddenly, she never got it. 
01:25:25: By then, Tammara had created a demo with one of the Disco Twins. Spyder-D had also taken Tammara to Power Play Studios. Tammara talks about Spyder-D’s involvement with drugs.

01:27:20: Tammara circles back to explain how she introduced hip hop to Grover Cleveland High School.
01:28:10: Tammara had had an English project she didn’t complete, so she rapped for her presentation instead.
01:28:12: At this point in the interview, Tammara’s phone went off so the interview was paused. After she finished her phone conversation, Tammara began a story which the interviewer asked for her to continue on record. As a result, the interview resumed mid-story where she described what a jam was like. There was a DJ on either side of the park. They would take turns and whoever moved the crowd most would win.
01:29:00: By eighteen, Tammara was on her own.
01:29:20: Growing up, Tammara would use her anger towards her father to influence her raps.
01:29:30: Tammara recites one of her old raps.
01:30:40: Tammara talks about the impact of cocaine on her crew. She describes it as “having taken her crew.”
01:31:08: Tammara ended up on welfare for some time.
01:31:20: Tammara discusses the move from parks to venues for jams. Tammara argues that Queens was the first borough that had in-house MCs.
01:32:42: Jams at parks became dangerous with the growing drug problem in the MC community. Tammara discusses some of the more well-known gangs from the time, including the Black Spades which went from Bronx into Flushing. Seven Crowns was in Jamaica. Hip hop battles were supposed to replace weapons with words in fights between gangs, but the drug problem brought violence into the park jams. Cocaine and freebase coke made the clubs dangerous as well and changed the hip hop culture.
01:34:45: At this point in the interview, Tammara’s phone went off again so the interview was paused. It was decided that the interview would continue on a different day. The rest of her story can be heard on Interview Day 2 with Tammara Tillman.

Summary: Tammara Tilman continues her story about growing up in the MC community in Queens. Throughout this second interview, Tammara reflects primarily on the changes in the MC community during the crack epidemic. She discusses the losses in the community, as well as her own bouts with the addiction. Tammara reflects on the end of her MC career in the early 1990s and her recent decision to come out of retirement to work on her music once again.
00:00:53: Tammara begins to discuss the impact of the crack epidemic on the hip hop community in the 80s, starting with coke. Because Tammara was so much younger than the rest of the MC crowd, this initial wave of drugs did not impact her as much. She was sometimes three or four years younger than the rest of the crowd.
00:01:40: Crazy T, a significant contributor to hip hop from the south side of Queens was part of a group called the Imperial 5 [spelling?]. Crazy T’s cousin, Fat Cat Nicholas, was one of the “big-time” drug dealers in Queens. He brought a lot of the drugs to Queens.
00:02:25: Coke had been done casually until freebasing emerged and it became an epidemic. When crack became widespread it “broke families, lives apart.” It had huge repercussions for the hip hop community.
00:03:15: Her cousin Disco J (Street name: Jamaica) was a member of the Seven Crowns gang. Other gangs in Queens were the Nomads, and the Black Spades, though they were predominantly in the Bronx. Her cousin’s cousin Hubert Junior was a Black Spade up in the Bronx who brought the Spades to Flushing. These former “gangbangers” turned MCs were now addicted to drugs.
00:04:10: Tammara discusses the difference in the effects of marijuana vs the other drugs on the MC community.
00:04:20: Tammara recites an old rhyme about marijuana.
00:04:30: “Then here came this white powder.” Member of the MC community were dying off.
00:05:10: Tammara talks about the mixing of crack and heroine called “Space-basing”. People were overdosing. At one point, “they just started shooting the heroine.” Crazy T got strung out in the 80’s from the heroine. Her cousin, Jamaica, was shooting heroine and smoking crack.
00:06:07: Early on, Tammara wanted no part of it when she was in college. It made her feel like she was out of her body. She unintentionally smoked a joint and she did not like it. 
00:06:53: Tammara talks about the falling out with her foster family when she was eighteen. She was turned out of the house on the day her trust fund was supposed to come through from her father and she never got it. Her foster mom would not let Tammara stay to wait for the phone call from her father about meeting with him for her trust fund.
00:09:50: After being kicked out of her foster home, Tammara stayed with a friend in Flushing off Kissena Blvd. Her friend’s father would smoke weed with the kids and snort coke. He would also smoke crack. When she was in Flushing she put her demos, old flyers, and yearbooks and other belongings into storage. She stayed there for a month until she had enough money to rent a room off of 77th Ave.
00:10:50: Tammara dropped out of school six months before she was supposed to graduate. She regretted it, as she was a smart student.
00:11:20: She reflects on her English teacher who had seen her potential after she MCed for a project in his class. He helped her get into the Grover Cleveland High School’s “mini school” which was a program for students who were falling behind.
00:11:50: Tammara delves into the difficulties that arose following her sexual assault three weeks before her eighteenth birthday. She had stopped MCing. The man who had raped her preyed on her because she was a female MC. She had remembered the rapist’s name and his license plate number, but her foster mother placed the blame on Tammara and did not help her in following up with an investigation. Tammara found out later on that she had caught an STD.
00:13:00: Her foster sister told people about her STD. It was difficult to find the relief in MCing that she used to get because her foster sister had spread rumors about it. 
00:13:39: In the early 1980s, following these incidences, Tammara went off on her own, bought her own place and enrolled in the Jamaica Learning Center.
00:14:09: Tammara talks about the B-boys from the Bronx. She would rap for them while they danced.
00:14:30: Tammara failed her GED by two points and was discouraged. She decided to enroll in Interborough Institute because she wanted to learn about contracts.
00:14:49: Although wary, Tammara got back into MCing. She went to Def Jam after running into Spyder D in Hollis. She didn’t go to Jam Master Jay, due to her sexual assault making her hesitant around men.
00:15:20: Her best friend, Kim, was involved in crack as well. Tammara describes the different types of cocaine, including lacing joints. While Tammara describes herself as being a “pothead”, she had refrained from doing these harder drugs because she saw the impact it had on others.
00:16:10: She met Chris Curry in college. He used to work for the Amsterdam News. She used to freestyle rap in college and Curry wanted her to do a jingle for a lotto commercial. 
00:17:17: Tammara had an anxiety attack being in the proximity of three men due to her sexual assault. She had difficulty with the verses of the jingle as a result. She was able to recite the verses when they were not in the room. The jingle was pitched to networks, but they weren’t open to hip hop at the time.
00:17:55: Tammara graduated from Interborough Institute as a Dean’s List student despite being homeless. Her landlord illegally evicted her.
00:18:21: Tammara tracked down her godmother, Teresa, who was living on Jewel Ave. At this time, Tammara was doing business with the Disco Twins. One of the twins liked her godmother.
00:19:15: Tammara witnessed hip hop going mainstream. People from Queens had expected her to make it big. But her rape and the loss of her father’s money negatively impacted her and put her in a bad place.
00:20:07: Because Tammara was unable to take all her belongings to her godmother’s house, she put her things into storage in Flushing on Kissena. The man who had put her stuff into storage died due to his drug addiction. She has not seen that stuff since.
00:21:00: She submitted a demo to Russell Simmons that she had done with one of the Disco Twins.
00:21:19: The hip hop industry was chiefly male. It was difficult for women to get into it, especially in Queens, where there was less camaraderie than there was up in the Bronx. Tammara was discouraged.
00:22:14: Tammara moved around but ended up in Far Rockaway with her mother and her older brother. While she attended Interborough, Tammara worked for an electronics manufacturer called Concord for a year and a half.
