Summary:	Eva Tremaine is an author  and in this interview she talks about some of the  hurtles she overcame to become an author.

00:00:00	I grew up in Jamaica.

00:01:20*	I started sugar and spice book club. Everyone had to right a short story. I came up   with a short story. A couple authors read the short story and they encouraged me to write a book. That’s how I wrote my first book “unstable”
00:03:45*	My book ideas and titles come to me in a dream. My characters talking to me tat come to me at the most inappropriate times.
00:05:20	Writing is also a business for my first book I didn’t research how it should be done. You need to study your craft and the best way to release a book.
00:07:05 Unstable was about a child who was having a mental break, So I met with a child psychologist and went to a psychiatric facility. Being authentic and believable is very important to me.
00:08:40* Don’t let fear cripple you and keep you from achieving your dream of being an author.
