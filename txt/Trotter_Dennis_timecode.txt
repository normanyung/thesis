Summary:	Dennis trotter is and electrician and an electrical engineer who started as a DJ in south Jamaica during the 1970’s and 1980’s. Mr. Trotter talks about how he got into rap and how Rap started in Queens and how he participated in the movement.


00:01:05	In 1969, I moved to Jamaica. It was beautiful manicured lawns. Not just in Jamaica estates but in south Jamaica as well. In the early to mid 70’s south Jamaica, Hollis, St. Auburn these areas started to become more Hispanic and black.

00:03:06	mid 1980’s had the first person shot. That’s when things started to get bad. The infiltration of the crack crisis. There were gangs like the supreme team. Crack didn’t hit the scene until 84-85. The supreme team used to tell people this is our corner now and if you were there later they killed you.
00:09:47 In early 1975 Dennis Trotter made his own DJ system. He realized that he still needed a base and made one out of a little flower pot in his house. Then one day he was using it and he realized that both side turners were playing.	

00:11:20 My friend that	lived across the street Ralf McFarland. He went into the marines but when he came back in about 1977 he said we were going to do something big. Then in 1979 they started selling commercial mixers in Jamaica and we went out and bought one. My first group was RJ Ralf junction but I was just a Dj/ mixer. The group I first started really playing with was atomic sounds. We’d go out to the park.
13:22 Once we got a real mixer we started playing at the monarch bar on 122 and Liberty. So he got me together with EC Irving (Irvin Evans) Who I called bugsy. In 1978 we starting playing together. We did a big club jam together at a club called 20 Grand. There was me and bugsy and this other group atomic sound and in the summer of 1980. we bought a couple of b1 and d1 amplifiers. We were in liberty park at least 6or 7 days a week.
16:22 There was another group called unique sound. That actually challenged us to a battle. The crowd just gravitated to us. They invited us to play in their turf near Ps116 and we won again. Then in the third face off we brought a spot light and we won again.
20:09 At the end of the summer we also had battles with the infinity machines, groups Grandmaster  Flash and Kid Flash. So we decided to go after some of the biggest rappers. We had an Mc Sweet Tea come in for us one day. Whenever we did a show we practiced for two days before. We set a standard as far as queens goes. The battles brought peoples best game out. 
24:03 At the end of the summer Atomic sound kind of fell apart. One of the main people fell apart Honcho who I called Bill Blast or Grandmaster Funk. Got death threats from other rappers and decided he was leaving at the end of the summer.  And right now I DJ with my Ipad.

29:02 One of the most famous first raps was Jack and Jill. And then it went to other thing “Jack and Jill went up the hill Jack fell down and broke his crown.” The whole mixing and playing music continuously came later and became rapping in the early 70’s. 1979 was the first time rap was played on the radio.

39:30 Record Explosion (record store) opened up on 168 street and Jamaica ave and for 99 cents we were buying these giant singles. This was the start of the Disco single.

43:20 Now, I am an electrical engineer as well as an electrician. It was those walkie talkies back when I was five that got me to take everything a apart an start me on this path.
