Dan: What is your earliest…
Banks: Earliest memory of queens is when I went home with a girl who turned out to be my girlfriend she lived in queens. I was living in Brooklyn south prospect park and this is about 1987 and I giver her a ride home she lived in Steinway street in Astoria and um lets see we were an item for about 3 years but my first impression of queens was coming to Astoria I had just moved into New York City and all of it was new, uh living in uh Brooklyn with a man who was a friend of a friend who happened to have a room and I um it was sort of tough quarters there, let me try to speed through this but this building in Brooklyn happened to be filled with people from Tibet. It wasn’t a Tibet neighborhood it was just this building and it started with one guy from Tibet cause we can cause he brought more and he filled up this whole building with Tibet. That was on quartile road and um lived there for about a year uhh and then um girlfriend… she was a topless dancer… Halloween she was leaning against a parking meter on ST. marts place avenue A wearing just a little velvet dress and had no costume except the blood on the side of her mouth and big vampire teeth oh yeah she was drinking wild turkey straight outta the bottle like this lively lass and then uh I just walked up to the parking meter and put a quarter in and said “ I got you for 15 minutes” and anyway we went to her place she was a seasoned new Yorker from long island and all that. I’m this goofy hick from Tennessee and uh she just thought it was a one night stand ya know and then head back the next day and it blew her mind. It was great man we had a good thing uhhh lets see that was Astoria, Astoria I loved in that time in the 80s uh Astoria was uh still a safe neighborhood it was being patrolled by guys named Nick, Big Mike, Guy and tony driving around in Trans-Ams with baseball bats uh cause they were keeping the Puerto Ricans out it was a very safe neighborhood
Dan: not official law enforcement 
Banks: oh no no no it was the Greek boys you know uh yeah sure and uh the other impression I had about uh Astoria was uh is um the Greek orthodox churches ya know, churches are a friendly place but and one time people were coming out of the Greek orthodox church the women who were very traditional and all that I’m this hick from Tennessee and I’m like “excuse me ma’am can you tell me what time it is” HISSSSSSSSSSS and I’m like wow jeez she just like hissed at me. Coming out of church and hissing at me I was confused I get it now, okay well that was my first impression of queens but we lived next to this bocce ball court it was on Steinway and 5th mars Steinway, lets see around there there was this huge bocce court and ahhh man I definitely got the full flavor of uh the queens and Astoria and Greek and Italian men and uh I always loved New York City and I arrived up here and yes New York City has been uh great to me I’m here because of the variety of people the smorgese board New York City and queens but you have people from all over the world you know growing up in America growing up in Tennessee its you know you have black people and white people and you know they shop at kmart watch the news and its so so harmonized and uh come up here and its every block is a different country 
Dan: Did you always see yourself moving to a bigger city I know… from Tennessee to New York that seems like such a huge 
Banks: I had a great love for New York and uh a it seemed like my mother was involved in theater my uh older sister uh we always appreciated like broadways and musicals and stuff and I grew up uh you know listening to great musicals things like guys and dolls are you familiar with that?
Dan: yeah living with the parents you kind of pick up on those things 
Banks: Sure and all the great old movies uh and um yeah I was at an early age by uh the uh this spirit of um the industrial revolution but the after world war 2 the big industrial boom and the great America all sort of philosophy that America was the greatest and um art deco architecture as a little kid iw as fascinated by uh new york city and by uh art deco architecture and um when I went to elementary school in Tennessee at the time was not uh the greatest public school system in the country and so the books that I learned to read on were like books form the 50s and stuff and it was all films that were you know sort of back dated so I got sort of a full measure of that sort of propaganda like you know we are an industrialized sort of nation 
Dan: it was probably even more extreme down in Tennessee 
Banks: Sure, uh yeah I didn’t always, it was sort of the formative years I went to a private school for a while so I got a fine education but I do remember my early textbooks and early films fascinated me as this great America thing and then as a lad, the sort of disillusion that Vietnam it was sort of like the war that we didn’t win, we won everything, and then uh seeing the cars go mammoth to like getting smaller, the 70s was even kind of the bubble bursting on the great America thing uhhh but what brought me to New york was this fascination with uh um sort of art deco and architecture and you know the spirit of New York in its um old movies and stuff. But I wasn’t essentially planning on moving here lets see uh I visited here in uh 1974 we passed through I saw it and came back in 1976 I uh neighbor and his best friend and his mother they stayed 2 days in downtown loved it, came back in 78 my cousin was a hostess at the lone star café a famous venue in um west village history Lone star roadhouse , uh that was 1978 anyway I wasn’t planning on moving here I did my plot and went to art school in 1980 and uh anyway fast forward the tape im back in Columbus Ohio in 1986 and a girlfriend of mine there, just a friend, can you give me a ride to new york city, I asked 5 people so far in the 11th hour and they backed out I’ve got a place lined  up I have a job lined out I just need a ride and you got a good car. And I got this chill, I’m like yeahhhhh sure ill give you a ride to New york yeah and im getting chills now just thinking about it. So I’m kind of spooky im like yeah  sure well she says you can stay for a week ya know fine. Well this was in uh Brooklyn and prospect park it was this beautiful uh I go straight to Washington square park and um and fall in with these street musicians who take me to an improve standup theatre thing and I’m just absolutely fell in live you know im like this is it I go back to Columbus Ohio where I was living just gave everything away, I had a Volkswagen in my garage, I took the plates off of it  I had my Toyota as a second car, gave away everything except my clothes and a guitar and came up here the car got towed the night before I was leaving and that sort of took all of my money to get it back and I was like god I might not have enough money uh am I going to be crawling back home with my hat in my hand and I had this epiphany like no, don’t even let your fears and doubts have a chance to form an image, think about your dream and don’t ask how this is when I was 25 and yeah had that thought and uh ya know I’m doing the calculations  I had just enough gas money to get up there  with $20 leftover. And then like I go for it and then I’m going to get my car um and then I look down on the ground and there’s a $10 bill and no body is around and I say you know what that’s just my luck, ever since then, I’m like you know what just my luck. And then I call my operation JML industries, and then it stuck 
Dan: Just my luck industries
Banks: but uh yeah and I did wind up getting to town with $20 in my pocket and a place to stay for a week with the girl I’ve given a ride. And uh I immediately went down to 9th avenue and got a job at a car wash washing cars and detailing cars uhhh I did that for about a month until um I had experience with exotic cars kind of being a stable boy not at a ranch but taking care of exotic cars at a place called exotic car emporium hired me as a foreman of a detail shop so all of a sudden I had a good job and um boom so oh and part of this job was delivering Porsche 911s to Yonkers and back so uh I get here with $20 bucks and like about 6 weeks later I’m driving porches down the road just my luck. So you know what I am rambling there but that’s my first impression of queens and uh just uh coming to this town and uh you know its funny I still have the same love for new york city same excitement I uh don’t know how it is I dig it all of my hippy and artist friends have so many different temps of art I’ve heard of so long “oh its not what it used to be the scene used to by better”
Dan: what’s your opinion on that? 
Banks: this is a great scene now it keeps changing its just human nature, just nostalgia 
Dan: better than what it used to be or do you think its..
Banks: in a lot of ways its not as much of a spirit not as much as an art scene necessarily its not as unified or cohesive we didn’t have the common I mean uh I guess it was this common enemy of like it was sort of a hippie thing and you could still be rebellious 
Dan: So you think it was kind of more underground?
Banks: uh yeah because you could still shock 
Dan: oh okay 
Banks: and now yeah so maybe that’s why people say there’s not as much a scene meyabe because uh well it’s pretty hard to shop 
Dan: Especially with the Internet 
Banks: Sure 
Dan: everything is just information overload 
Banks: Sure but the town is very livable now law and order the infrastructure ive lived here through the 80s and 90s when there was the crack epidemic and it really was a dangerous place
Dan: do you want to talk about that a little? 
Banks: on that uh lets see, we can go off on that lets try to get to the big scope where else are you trying to go is there an end 
Dan: um there’s no end point honestly its just really an hour um  I kind of just want to pick as much as I can with your experiences with your experiences in New York City and then 
Banks: Sure 
Dan: kind of form that and see where you were and kind of are now and just kind of ride that ride I guess you could say through your experiences 
Banks: um ill defiantly do that, 86 and 87 I was with uh Cornelia the dancer but she the girl had no faith she thought that we die it was just gray and anyway this is kind of an incompatibility I had been, I got a job Dan: Didn’t realize that went off im pretty sure it still records though, were good
Banks: okay 
Dan: yeah keep going 
Banks: I uh lets ee im not sure why I stopped with the auto detailing job at exotic car emporium on the west side highway I uh but I got a job delivering flowers for Charles Floral in Astoria. Charles Floral a guy Filipo, he had inherited the business from his father. Who had established this floral company on Broadway in Astoria probably in the 50s or something his son had it. Well, they had it was a very reputable florist and Filipo was just absolutely the archetypical Queens hustler guy and you know but um there, as a driving delivery man I got to see so much of queens and New York City but in particular, the funeral homes around Astoria didn’t realized this they were like listen dude they’re mob fronts. 
Dan: really
Banks: mafia you know the mob there still alive its not like the were in the glory days now they have back then they had the paving uh contracts that they don’t have now but and the carting, the trash, but now its like just the trash in Staten island, but you know the stereotypes come from somewhere sure enough, uh as uh that was one the major impressions of queens still being the kind of country boy from Tennessee uh delivering flowers ot these funeral homes and queens and sure enough there was always a big mike, nick, Gus, and tony and always with the pinky rings and everything and these stereotypes come from somewhere well I got to see it they actually didn’t know what to make of me because I realized now they thought that I was pulling some type of a scam because I was raised to say yes ma’am and no ma’am and please and thank you. 
Dan: okay
Banks and so there’s these tough guys and all that and I’m like yes sir thank you 
Dan: and they’re just like whoa haha
Banks and like you know they thought I was you know, 
Dan: who is this guy
Banks: and then they realize that I was legit so I became friends with them but on Valentines Day I would take like a dozen roses to this I guess mobsters wife. Have you ever seen the movie married to the mob?
Dan: yes
Banks: okay, well you know what like the set of that so they give the flowers from Charles Florals 
Dan: the mental picture is there now 
Banks: and in that interview I saw the movie married to the mob im like oh my god I deliver the flowers to these people and so um lets see I can go down any number of tangents say like talking about the crack epidemic and all that but generally you know what if this is about queens and New York City in general but my love I have a powerful affection for um all of the city. Manhattan, Brooklyn, I lived in bush wick for a while uh and queens and now here, long island city I would go on about that but for me its just the greatest place on earth. And uh its you know not for everyone but for me just like the variety in your diet, you just eat the same thing everyday your body doesn’t have that many vitamins and minerals to choose from
Dan: you need a little bit of everything 
Banks: yeah if you get a variety in your diet then you’re you’re healthier. Well culturally I feel like that while I move out of the United States and move to new york because I’m spoiled now god the variety of culture it uh its uh its very healthy 
Dan: have you um I know you’ve said when you were delivering flowers, the yes maam and the no maam thing, and that cultural difference, have you noticed that thaths always played like a major factor in your time up in New York City going from Tennessee have you like when you kind of realized like that little thing you always grew up with was different up here?
Banks: Oh absolutely and I’ve kind of learned to capitalize but not exploit it or anything but to realize that this was an asset I had because the uh mob and once they realized that I wasn’t making a game and that I was legit they appreciated it and also just we even had a lot of money we weren’t upper middle middle class or rich and all that but I never got any inheritance or anything like that but but to be raised ot have manors is like id rather have that than have been given a trust fund. It has served me so well in New York City because its for a real its not nay kind of calculated agenda its just uh yeah there is uh you know I say stereotypes come from somewhere well southern hospitality it comes form somewhere Nashville has a reputation for being a very friendly town and I feel and yes respect and yeah just the yes maam and no maam 
Dan: even driving from Ohio to New York when you drove that girl here, do you think that, well that kind of goes off the southern hospitality thing who else would do that you know? 
Banks: well I’m uh you know that’s a, maybe I’m a freak 
Dan: Do you think you would have came to New York City if it wasn’t for that or uh do you think it was a turning point
Banks: yeah you know come to think of it if it hadn’t had been that, something else would have brought me here and that uh almost like a chemical reaction I don’t know if you’re familiar with the book the secret, well its this fundamental philosophy about the law of attraction that like combines with like. Uh like meets like, and whatever you’re about, whatever thoughts you’re putting out, you will find other people with the same thoughts for this harmonic 
Dan: kind of like you attract what you put out 
Banks: yeah and so me and New York city uh it was sort of almost an inevitability uh my girlfriend Clare and I you know were talk about oh just how faith had it that we met each other the night we did at this local bar but I got to thinking have we not met that night, we would have met somewhere else in the neighborhood
Dan: You truly believe that 
Banks: yeah so I only mention that that yeah I would have come here because I think its like that harmonic version why I love new york city is because it is a magnet for strivers and uh you know people who are different or very individual uh people how are out of place in Duluth Minnesota or you know sure people who are just too creative for rural culture come here
Dan: So you think New York City fosters all that stuff
Banks: oh absolutely and that’s what makes it not for everybody you know its just too much work and too much compression for a lot of people but people who its for you know its uh yeah I uh say that they say that oh there is electricity in the air uh its not just a metaphorical thing no our bodies have an electrical system and we have like magnetic field and all that well just the kind of sensation of all these bodies you feel the electricity from all the people and um the uh oh god you know its just electrifying that’s what brings me to new york city is the energy the spirit it’s the most yes a creative place and um 
Dan: I feel the same way though I’m from believe it or not in New Jersey we have its rural parts so northwest jersey the joke that used to be there is there’s more cows than people in the town I’m from and even today just driving into the city just seeing the skyline and even when I was a kid I still get I still feel that those like chills I still have that overwhelming sensation I understand what you’re saying and that connection um so like your youth growing up in school you said um like do you have any experiences in school especially in terms of like art and everything, how did you actually cause like art obviously brought you into the city the creativity, when you were a child what where did you start realizing like okay art and this creative side this is part of who I am when did you start noticing that and how did you build on that? 
Banks: Um my as a kid I’m not an artist I’m a painter 
Dan : are these yours by the way that’s a mustang right?
Banks: yes it’s the letters L O V E there and the story on that to digress just to digress as an artist lets a few years back  I was working on something and I thought wow if I super impose the letters l o v e  as a composition for one of my landscapes I drew this in one of my books to make a part of a universe I made this sketch just arbitrary thinking let me super impose the letters  L O V E that’s my mothers yard in Tennessee
Dan: oh so that’s actually a real place
Banks: it’s a real place and I have made this sketch in my book because I am all about that love is the energy that energy is love that we that this is a manifestation of love uh this is love its alive love is everything im all about it well anyway so I made this and then arbitrarily looked up and saw the E I’m like holy shit here it is this is in real life and I have seen it in my head and that’s like its chilling its like great that’s what I have been trying to say that love is the fabric of the universe
Dan: That’s awesome
Banks: thanks uh well lets see you know um through my 
Dan: So yeah growing up and art 
Banks: oh yeah it wasn’t that I had such a passion for art I just learned to draw at an early age at first I was fascinated by clipper ships like at the age of 5 or 6 and bi-planes, world war 1 bi-planes oh yeah as a little kid we had this encyclopedia and uh this is like 1965 whatever but they had this red illustrated panel of airplanes from world war 1 and world war 2 and as a three year old kid I was engrossed in this and by the age of like 4 or 5 I was not only drawing them but I was taking piece of cardboard and I would cut out and make these bi planes out of a cardboard from a shirt and the other thing too but ill try to speed it up my brother would come home from high school and on his um notebook he had been doodling the cube and perspective and maybe I saw him do it where you take these two and connect it up and boom but so yeah I must have been 4 years old but I started doing that just from his notebook I remember drawing an alarm clock you know with the bell and doing that just like anyway by the age of 6 I was drawing bi planes in 3 point perspective because I would super impose that and uh Harley Davidson choppers and dragsters you know with the blower and all that and that fascinated me I drew them school was always like some sort of punishment for me I would do that the only thing I aced was lunch I would participate and all that but  I didn’t like all that and I would draw. It wasn’t so a great love for art uh and but I became a detailed skilled draftsman at an early age and when I got to high school a uh teacher in commercial art said you she said you got no choice she enrolled me in three hours of commercial art uh 10th grade 11th grade 12th grade  I was a commercial art every day and I got a scholarship to CCAD Columbus College of Architect and Design in Columbus Ohio a very good school and I learned fundamental of deign and that was the first time I had been really like taught how to paint learned some painting in highs school the basic shapes and fundamental things but as far as painting and you know it still wasn’t painting for the love of painting or anything like that I uh went to CCAD and I majored in industrial design okay and fine, but then uh you know it was a very tough school and tough course I made it through the first year but uh for whatever reason I withdrew and moved, I graduated High school in 1980 and at that time my mother she had been divorced since I was 12 we were a close family and all that uh but she remarried in 1980 to a man in Birmingham Alabama so in 1982 I was overloaded at CCAD with the industrial design and I bailed I moved in with my mother in Birmingham and I was like well ill get my academic credits so I went to the university of Alabama Birmingham and um in part of my academic credits was American literature and uh also I enrolled in painting there. Went from a professional art school structure where its very serious CCAD is the sister school of the art institute of Chicago they have the same curriculum and the same foundation here so I go down to Birmingham Alabama and it’s a bunch of doctors wives who have started a painting class but the instructor Dr. Edith Crower, not Dr. but Edith Crow she was a very good teacher and uh I got into the painting class but at the same time American literature I started reading Flannery O’Connor I don’t know if you’re familiar with the author
Dan: I heard of the name 
Banks: Well the main thing is that main writers like John Steinbeck and uh they use allegory and symbolism you know the story is about one thing but if you read between the lines its making a big comment on the whole human condition. Flannery O Connor uh did that an I uh it was just part of American literature to read these short stories it turned us on to symbolism and the language of you know the metaphor and all that but I would say that Flannery O Connor influenced me more as a painter than even like my favorite painters like Monet
Dan: Really? Banks: yeah uh because she if you just give somebody a fact it just goes in one ear and out the other but if you give them a riddle and they have to solve it then it sticks with them and its this “ah ha” moment for example Flannery O’Connor in some of her stories say she is describing a um farm house with the fence around it and an out building and another field around that and a tree line around that she describes it but then you realize she’s describing the solar system the moon and that its like ah haaaa and it blows your mind so I started uh when I left university of Alabama Birmingham left Alabama left my mothers house moved back to Columbus Ohio and went back to CCAD and as taking fine art paintings I scrapped industrial design part of the thing was look you’ll end up in a cubicle designing cafeteria trays for delta airlines ya know this is the work in commercial design until you get up in the work designing cars you’ll be designing medical equipment and stuff and like ill go with the fine art ya know actually just because I needed something to say I’m doing. 
Dan: that’s why I’m in school haha
Banks: yeah lets see and uh girlfriend in Birmingham and um her father was a very famous physicist and was the astronomy professor at University of Alabama Birmingham and at the time he was a celebrity because he had been in Omni Magazine he and his colleague were the authors of uh the concept of the black hole and he was mentioned in that. But he synthesized stardust in a laboratory and that put him on the book by analyzing the light structure whatever he made some chunks in like this is what a stars made and uh he was a man who was raised by his grandparents in Germany and they never picked him up that was like no love he was a brilliant scientist but rotten father and his daughter they had sort of a violent relationship well anyway my time in Birmingham was occupied by all that and this girl screwed up and you know she was a good girl and very intelligent but she she was sticking her head in the gas oven like once a month and just it was you know this isn’t where I wanted to go with this but finally after a couple years of me trying to be the white knight and and save somebody well uh it’s a cool apartment I go out of town I Tuscaloosa my car breaks down I spend three days in the parking lot changing the timing chain on a chevy 350 station wagon in a parking lot I did that oh my god and put the thing back together I was black and it still didn’t start and the guy at the gas station went hold on finally pulls out the distributor pulls out the rotor and gets another and pops it in and it turns yeah it wasn’t the timing chain that I replaced anyway I get back to my cool apartment on the side of the hill in Birmingham and Celeste is moving in and uh oh my go well anyway I can mainly go on that but I finally left Birmingham Alabama because I like needed to get away from this girl who you know is no animosity or anything like that but its just I was just like  I need to leave the state and uh anyway I call her up are you alright you’re not going to kill yourself and she was like oh by the way  I am shagged up with Eddy my best friend you know I mean im thinking shes going to kill herself but I take off and she is with our best friend and I learned a lesson you know what you cant be the white knight but me to digress on that but that’s what took me out of Birmingham and that part to back to Columbus Ohio and I was in Columbus Ohio for a couple years doing the painting and working at specialty sports cars where  I was the stable boy for exotic cars they had 3 GT40s which is if you know are very exotic cars and oh god all these old Ferraris and Lamborghinis and jaguars.  They used  to do a lot of ground up restoration on Jaguars. Well when you do that all the parts are sand blasted and spray-painted and that’s what I did. I didn’t turn the wrench but I did everything else. Love cars I still love cars my blood type is 10w40 but um so well try to keep it concise lets see uh so yeah that brought me to Columbus for a couple of years I was uh dating a girl and that was you know I don’t know fading out went to visit Birmingham for a long summer and then I just come back from Columbus and was just about to get settled back in and that’s when the girl said give me a ride and and this was in 1986 and then so I had totally moved back into my apartment and was like you know what don’t let me down, which I didn’t and uh 
Dan: Did you have any like I know that a part of you you always knew you planned on coming back to New York was there ever that voice in your head or butterflies in your stomach where you were just like oof or where you dead set on it like you didn’t care?
Banks: nah I uh I didn’t expect to but I told her that when I came up here and went to Washington square park uh and then I met the street musicians that took me to um a got me involved in this improve theatre also there was a girl there I developed a crush on, and uh some of my friends who I gone to art school with in Columbus who at that time were working with Mark Gostavi who was a painter who employed all he did was sign the work, this was part of his shtick, is that he didn’t make it, he hade a factory of people who made the work, it was his idea they would paint and he would sign it and it was a splash in the pane in the 80s. I thought and there was a possibility that I would work with him in the factory and then I met this girl and as far as the new york city, well just those factors well everything fell into place on top of the love that I always had for new york city and um and uh it just yeah was my big ah ha moment I mean it was I knew it once I started to do it but it hadn’t been my plan if it hadn’t been for that girl saying to come up here once I got up here then I was like ahh there’s the answer that was it like that’s what I wanted to do and uh then I always also thought that I would make my mark on the art world but the world in general and visions and uh I see now that we all do that you know I came up here like I want to have my paintings in the metropolitan museum in my lifetime or the Whitney or the MOMA any of the big ones I wanted to do this to prove im a big painter and all that uh I uh still have these ambitions but that’s not what drives me I narrowed it down about uh as an artist my greatest creation is myself and let me be the art be the beauty let me be the creative force and if I make a painting great fine but I’m the art and I think that’s true for all of us too we think that the legacy that we leave the impact we make on life is fine, philanthropically organizations these big facades you know that people leave a legacy that’s fine and legit but I believe that the wake that you make when you walk down the street the look that you exchange in every persons eyes that is your legacy and who you are right now in any given day and we don’t realize how the ripple that you make in the pond reaches the distant shore and the waves that you enjoy. 
Dan: no project aside I think that’s not only just for an artist to live what they do but in general I don’t think, I think part of it is associated with your upbringing and everything but I think now more than ever thing of live what you want to be type thing isn’t that common and I think that’s something that should be more apparent that’s awesome
Banks: I never put a lot of stock in like reincarnation or but ive been told that maybe im an old soul and I’m starting to see that now because uh I just my perspective uh is well just that I’ve come up with something like that I used to be so ambitious about maybe more material things and um 
Dan: kind of a bigger picture thing?
Banks: more isn’t in yeah and uh I’m very happy with uh my evolution 
Dan: I like that world evolution 
Banks: yeah um and uh I have been I guessed in trusted with a lot of real gifts that I feel like I wouldn’t have given a combination of what I love and been given this because I’m not selfish I don’t give it away I don’t you know I care about all the treasures in this world they’re great and legit and all that but its all like the same man I’ve invested in what I can take with me this is uh this is for everyone the joys of my heart and my memories is solid and no one can ever take it away I can take it with me haha. I guess I do I guess I say I’m a freak because from an early age I thought about what is death death means to cease to exist and I think at the age of 12 you cant cease to exist when you already exist I never believed in death 
Dan: it’s a good way to look at things 
Banks: yeah a good um well and now I mean it was kind of a vague thing and now I um do I’m very comfortable to see that this 100 years span we have this incarnation on planet earth is the moment of many moments. One time I saw a liter of pups they hadn’t even opened their eyes like running around and trying to find the right teat and I just watched them and they all have distinct personalities these things are right out of the box some of them are one way some of them are the other way. And Im like we come to this planet already a complete package of who we are and just seeing the liter of puppies that started me onto it and now since I have kind of researched it more I do realize for years I thought that this was just a mind inside a body that was me harvest the radio playing inside I even made a series of paintings there’s a house with just a light of the TV on and I called it “The mind inside the body” that light of the TV inside the house is like the speaking mind inside the physical person and yeah for years I thought I was uh a mind in a body and now I realized there’s something that precedes that and realized that I was me when I was born and I will be me when I am gone. And uh I love that there’s an unknown 
Dan: You like that mystery?
Banks: Sure and I have learned the most counter intuitive things to trust complicity what you cannot see what you cannot control. Even uh counter intuitive things and yes grateful for all circumstances and you are a master of yourself which means I call it “Oh boy flat tire” no body wants a flat tire and you can say its purely circumstantial you know its not god saying “you’re going to have a flat now” or is it? Now I do see that the house is rigged this is my own opiate but yes that flat tire kept you out of a 10 car pile up yes that flat tire that you’re so pissed off about has altered the timeline and kept you from dying and you’ll never know it. But somehow I see it and I know and I am able to especially appreciate when things happen and trust it. 
Dan: I like that I think everybody should see the good and the bad
Banks: Since doing that my life has changed completely it takes the sting out of the hard times and when you are at your lowest and you are on the corner of this sucks and I’m fucked, if that time you can look up at the sky and say thank you, its powerful. If you can do that, nothing can touch you, and hell I have been through this I was so lonely but to continue on my queens and New York story uh shoot a girl who I was with, Cornelia the dancer, we broke up and then I was single for a couple of weeks and then I met Laura Cronenberg. We saw each other at the club and instantly, I asked her if she wanted to dance she stood up, and we started making out immediately. And uh I was like I am going to go warm up my car, it was January and she said she was going to go get her friends a cab fair, turns out she was about 15 years older than me and she was part of the andy Warhol scene and she was at Woodstock and she was in touch with whoever was still alive a lot of these Andy Warhol underground people died in the early years from debauchery and all that and the ones who were still alive she was in contact with she saw me as an artist and she was like, I quit my job and she had the money and we lived in park avenue south and uh we were together for about 18 years but in that time I made a series of paintings from they were an allegorical and metaphorical paintings like this American paradise, we can go into it but I have a lot of paintings oh yeah the muscle car, that’s a boss mustang, an American super power, America used to be the boss, the tire there has a letter E for eagle which if you read between the lines it says good year saying it was a Goodyear sort of that Flannery O’Connor symbolism that like the good year tire, hello good year boss Mustang, America the Boss, but anyway I uh did a series of paintings and made uh and started making my way in the art world at one man shows and uh Woodstock, one man shows at the Girshman gallery in New York City and other group shows and um it was uh some press it was making a debut into the art world still known was running with some artists who are now quite famous, uh Richard Hamilton, there’s  a man named Rene Ricard who has been instrumental in getting uh the who is the artist, black dude who did the graffiti he did I cant believe, um yeah so but anyway I was uh I kind of burnt out on it I had these expectations to sell my paintings for a couple thousand dollars, there was  a big art bubble in the 80s and people were selling and do some miserable thing and sell it for a lot but I was petered out I was working really hard on these big paintings and then selling, didn’t even want to sell them but had to sell them to get not for money but to get it out on people walls and I uh eventually burnt out on it and quit painting sort of, its not making me happy this art scene you know uh I am going to hang it up until it I enjoy the process I was doing it for the wrong reasons  I was doing it it prove I’m this painter and this and that it wasn’t making me happy si I will stop. I also was an alcoholic, well from staying up all night and drinking all night, I never got a hangover because I would do a hairy dog, which wound up to me not getting drunk but to me drinking, yeah until that caught up with me. Laura uh lets see we moved to park avenue uh to Bush wick because rent got so high and park avenue was real nice we had a good run there, 19th street in park avenue south in Newton square, right next to High Times magazine and the staff would come over and uh party at 4/20 in our apartment, I did the poster for the cannabis cup and they sent me and Laura to Amsterdam to be judges for the cannabis cup, I had some real high points uh the last few years in Bushwick it kind of went downhill and i was an alcoholic and I was taking drugs along with that I got busted going out to get drugs and then I could have fought the case but I knew I was a bad alcoholic and uh if I didn’t have a drink by noon my hands would shake I wasn’t eating and all that so when I got busted and the fingerprints down, the cop booking me said “Boy, this is the best thing that ever happened to you”
Dan: That goes back to the good and the bad thing as well
Banks: yeah I was like uh god this is going to suck and yeah soon I took treatment instead of incarceration because they had a shaky case but if I had gone to trial and lost I would be a big felon and be unable to vote and that was a primary thing I didn’t want to lose my right to vote my father was 1st Marine Division in World War 2 and I grew up with these two worlds, the Beatles, and Psychedelic, and all you need is love, and my father, who World War 2 hero, stories about him he was in four major actions uh in the pacific and anyway I have a great love for this country and our freedom. 
Dan: it shows in your paintings too 
Banks: and uh yes, many times, and at the same time I mean I’m very patriotic but I still have my own thing
Dan: it’s a good balance
Banks: yeah so anyway I uh didn’t want to lose my ability to vote and uh I got shipped off to treatment, which was good Laura died while I was in treatment and uh I was devastated, and um got through treatment and uh sobered up my health came back moved back to Nashville in 2010 and uh moved back to Nashville New York had kicked my ass, sent me back to Momma with my hat in my hand and my tail between my legs and uh I hated leaving New York but I had to go back home and start over uh and um and I did start over as a stage hand racket ive been doing stage handing up here but I was an alcoholic I didn’t show up drunk, but just from all those saturated and when I would sweat I would smell and they were like we love you and you work hard but clients smelling you we cant have you around and um I got back into stage handing and worked my way up uh and in Nashville it doesn’t pay that much stage handing because its not union and there’s a huge supply of people who want to be roadies so if you don’t like this, if you don’t want to take this job, there’s somebody who will, anyway worked my way up, oh here’s the main thing is that when I got out of treatment and my head was clear no drinking or all that I started to get back into painting but why do it and uh I felt like all my what I call narrative paintings that I do with a story people are like “Banks tell us about the B story tell us about this” ill tell you what come in here and take that ill show you the narrative part okay and as carry on with the story I switched over to uh I decided I was going to paint with light okay this is narrative this is called the “Immaculate Reception” but see, it’s a peace sign the base, and I made this the berlin wall had recently come down this is an old painting and uh I realized that the Berlin wall came down because uh they had been trying to keep the culture out and all that but the satellite dish goes over the fence and all of a sudden this country wants Levis, they want John Wayne, they want Rock and Roll they want Coca Cola and you cant stop, and I see all the dished divide into the seven sections to represent the seven seas,  you know this is just an example of my narrative work and uh like the boss mustang these are all from my imagination I just worked in the studio from a room with no reference its sort of narcissistic and as like like a drummer walking back to the studio to get his chops I’m like you know what I don’t want my voice involved in this you know let me get back to the fundamental painting of color and all that yeah I have this thing the only energy that comes off a painting is the energy that goes in and like why do it so this I had this epiphany when I got off drugs and alcohol why do it I realized I will only paint something if I love it. There’s something that I love, then it comes easy. This is a new one behind you, that’s Annabelle bison, and I don’t know if you can see the uh on the smokestack there there’s a candle and that is a video projection of a candle right there and uh Annabelle Bison is nearby over here and its going to be and they’re going to build a 90 story high rise where that factory is and my motivation is well let me go there and paint the sky while you can still see the sky and I get down there and I realize they have been videotaping this candle on there and I love the smokestack all the magnificent things that’s an example but I only paint things that I love and since then I don’t want to go into showing you my work and all that but this is a day I spent in France, this is is Central Park and it has meaning to me because at this particular spot it actually that girls name is Silvia and there’s a bunch in there you cant see, that’s Dennis who I have a relationship with and its deeply personal to me and actually I realized that I painting form life I realized that if I look at the painting later years later, because I remember every stroke, it teleports me back to that day and its always warm sunny days and I realize I’m not making a I’m illustrating my own life and that is and New York City factors into it so much I am making a its like trying to photograph a ghost that the spirit of New York City is, oh yeah I learned to, painting from life, I still have my narrative I still have my voice but I want to let just what I choose to paint tell its own story and that’s my narrative but here is an example, hello, alright, Long Island City, 
Dan: So while youre doing that, you actually hit on all the questions I wanted to talk to you about, 
Banks: Okay this is Bethesda fountain in central park, but you see that these angels is looking at the stops, she is perpetually looking at the stop light, I am like that is it! New York City, where the angels even have to wait. Its and so I’m able to have my voice but without it being over loud and I am continuing on that y affection for my subject matter and the piece I get into a sort of Zen like state when I am working because I am grateful for what is before my eyes I look at what we consider ordinary is extraordinary and just what is I can take the mundane and elevate it its spectacular I do it amplify it by talk about being in harmony with nature when I am painting a tree I am ingesting it I feel like Godzilla eating Tokyo I feel like Godzilla eating every tree and branch and through my hand I do live in harmony with it and that uh peace that I find when I am working is my expression for my love of creation its alive and its human nature but we cant help but take it for granted somehow talking about this gift this key I don’t take it for granted another thing is recovering from my addiction and alcoholism had I not gotten busted I probably wouldn’t be here now, alcohol can kill you. And so I have always been an optimist its not that bad ill do alright now looking back it sucked and so I was in a very dark place my self esteem when I went back I felt so worthless after being a child very mellow hearing you’re the next Da Vinci you’re the next Michelangelo like great this is a wrap then I get to be in my 20s and I realize maybe im not this I have to work for it its not here I don’t know 
Dan: Yeah so going off that, you hit every one of my questions by the way, that was awesome I didn’t even have to ask you just, it was such a natural flow that’s exactly what I wanted but, the last question I have, in two sentences, since we were talking about the past so much, what’s next for you, where do you see yourself?
Banks: Okay, if I boiled it down, 
Dan: all this past talk, what do you look for in the future, so
Banks: Sure, thank you 
Dan: Like 2 maybe 3 sentences, 
Banks: Okay, metaphorically speaking, I want to put together a string of work, powerful thought, and carve it into stone, my legacy. I see I am able to do that with the help of circumstance with love and uh so what I want from the future well is to carve into a powerful thought, okay what I want from the future, yeah is to hmm, good question, well you know what to feel as as good as I feel now the energy I feel now, and be in good spirits, I am in good spirits, in art, and mind, my place for the future is to continue to enjoy the journey and my life is ongoing science fair project in that we are born we came here from our cosmic travel and you take a step sort of off the planet and look at the totality of your 100 years  on earth and think of it as one moment of many moments so my time here on earth, oh yeah you’re born and your memory is wiped out, I remember, I actually do remember being in the crib, and I remember vividly from a year and a half onto it also I had this repressed memory for years and then it dawned on me about 7/8 years ago that I realized what that memory was I remember being circumcised uh I remember being like the pain you know but being completely disoriented. This is why I remember this I was like what the fuck is going on where am I, what is happening and it was dark and all that, I realized dude, that was when I was circumcised and then I don’t remember anything from when I was a year and half old and then I remember vividly  from that I mention that because I remember being at that age and yeah you’re memory is wiped clean and along the journey this 100 years we have you remember who we are and even create yourself and that is the thing I think of it this way Its funny my name is Clayton, Clayton is my last name and I looked it up and Clay-Ton is like tun a Tun is a vessel or a like an earth structure a Clay- Ton so I am an earthen Vessel. 
Dan: I want to end it right there I like that
Banks: Good ha-ha great
