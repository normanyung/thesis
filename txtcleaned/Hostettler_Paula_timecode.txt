“So we realized we already lived in the best neighborhood in New York.”

“I have lived in Sunnyside since 1972. There was a time when my husband and I thought we’d have enough money to live in Manhattan, so we checked all our best choices and after two days we decided that Manhattan was too crowded, noisy, impersonal and had no big grocery stores. So we realized we already lived in the best neighborhood in New York.

Because of a power outage on the 7 train I met a woman who has lived one block away from me for the last 35 years. We are now fast friends.

We have had a pretty serious feral cat problem, so various local groups formed a trap-neuter-return program and got the problem under control.

I learned a lot about my neighbors by meeting them as a campaign manager for a Republican candidate for City Council.”
