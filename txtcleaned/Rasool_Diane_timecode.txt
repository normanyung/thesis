Dianne Rasool has been a resident of Queens for fifteen years. She moved into her current home in South Richmond Hill two years ago. 

00:01:12       Dianne describes her neighbors as energetic, vibrant and sometimes noisy. She says the neighborhood is not very diverse and it consists of mostly East and West Indians. 
00:02:57   Dianne talks about the changes she has witnessed in her neighborhood. Overtime, South Richmond Hill has become overpopulated, less diverse, and the neighborhood’s property value has increased. She says the neighborhood does not have “the best stores”, are underdeveloped, and still has a lot of improvement to be made. However, the transportation and public services have also increased. 
00:06:29  Diane says the most common accents in her neighborhood are those from East Indian and West Indian immigrants. She also says she hears the occasional “Spanish accent”.  Immigrants have brought much of their own customs, apparel, and music from their native countries. 
00:08:37  Diane says the green space hasn’t changed much over the years she has lived in Queens. She says neighbors utilize their outdoor spaces. 
00:10:00   Dianne says she hopes for good things to happen to Queens over the next five years.  She is hoping changes made in time, technology and people will lead to new developments.
