Ellen Zilka tells her story of escaping Germany during the Holocaust via Kinderstransport and immigrating to the United States. 
Ellen was born in Berlin, Germany in 1928. When Hitler came to power, Ellen’s parents didn’t have the means to flee Germany, so they arranged for their children (Ellen, and her younger brother, who was 5 years her junior) to leave the country and go to England via Kindertransport. Ellen and her brother were sent separately and were placed in two different English families. Ellen lived in England for 7 years.

Arrival in the U.S., briefly
In late 1945, Ellen’s mother’s sisters, who were already living in the U.S., acquired a visa for her to come to the U.S. She immigrated to the U.S. in May 1946, arriving by ship in the port of New York.
